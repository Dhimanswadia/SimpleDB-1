SimpleDB for Thumbtack Coding challenge

Usage:
Simply run bash run.sh to start interactive mode to test simple database. (You need to have Java installed in your OS)

The SimpleDBTest.java is the main Class for testing. All the functions are implemented in SimpleDB.java. Currently it supports the following command:
                              SET
                              UNSET
                              GET
                              NUMEQUALTO
                              BEGIN
                              ROLLBACK
                              COMMIT
                              END
After user inputs each command, it will first do a sanity check to make sure the parameter with corresponding command could be conducted. If there is not such command or command is not correct, an reminder message will pop up.
